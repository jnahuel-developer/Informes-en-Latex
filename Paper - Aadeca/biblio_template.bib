	abstract = {This work presents a novel linear interpolation based methodology to design control algorithms for the trajectory tracking of mobile robotic systems. Particularly, a typical nonlinear multivariable system—a mobile robot—is analysed. The methodology is simple and can be applied to the design of a large class of control systems. Simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed, demonstrating the good performance of the proposed methodology.},

It concentrates on wheeled and legged mobile robots but also discusses a variety of other propulsion systems. The new edition presents advances in robotics and intelligent machines over the last 10 years, including significant coverage of SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) and multi-robot systems. It includes additional mathematical background and an extensive list of sample problems. Various mathematical techniques that were assumed in the first edition are now briefly introduced in appendices at the end of the text to make the book more self-contained"--Provided by publisher},
